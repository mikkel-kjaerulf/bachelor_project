This is the code for my bachelor project at the University Of Copenhagen. 

The two implemented algorithms: iterative proportional scaling and neighbourhood
coordinate descent were originally described by S. HÃ¸jsgaard and S. Lauritzen in the
paper "On some algorithms for estimation in Gaussian graphical models".
